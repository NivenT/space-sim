Another major function is the time bar.
This allows Cuta to change the rate of time flow to an arbitrary real number.
It could be -1x, 0x, 53.234x, or .01X speed.
Say Cuta saw an interesting 3-body interaction that went to fast for her to \
see.
He could go back to just before it happened, then put things in forward \
slow-mo.
Or maybe Cuta has a stable-looking orbit that she wants to see the long-term \
development of.
He can put things into 100x and see the years fly by.\
