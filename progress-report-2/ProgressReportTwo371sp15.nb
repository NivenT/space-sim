formulas (Examples:  determining the movement of a DNA fragment in a gel, the \

using etc  ...) which needed to first be researched or studied or developed.  \

you have an electronic copy of the reference, please include it with the \
material you submit - it will enough if it is electronic only).  Some \

why and explain the where in the file which information can be found. Include \

you have included code from the Internet, friends, the book, or blackboard, \

responsibility for part of the project. A general \"We worked on all of this \
together\" or an \"I helped xyz with all of this\" will not suffice to earn \
full points. Being responsible does not mean the group member needs to do all \
the work, but the group member must make sure the work gets discussed, added \
